            <h1 class="margin text-center">Movie Webpage Project</h1>
            <p>Context
              The project we were given was to make a webpage about a movie that we made up as a group. The reason for doing this was to put together all the HTML and CSS we have learned. The reason for this project was to test our understanidng of what we are learning and how we can build off of our capabilities of code.</p>
            <p>Overview
Me and my group decided to do the project about a man named Steve. He was your stereotypical nice guy who was tired of always being rejected and left by his girlfriends. The website thoroughly expressed his story of heart break and being driven into madness, and we used CSS and HTML to make it presentable and entertaining.</p>
          <p>Takeaways
The most difficult thing about my part in this project was to create a story that was entartaining but also had some sentamental value to it. This was our first time doing a project like this so it required a lot of creativity to create a story that pulls you in to actually want to tune in. It was hard to come up with the main parts of the story and make them really sentimental so I really had to focus on the plot of the story to connect each dot, and make it make sense.</p>
